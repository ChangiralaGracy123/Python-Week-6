# Python-Week-6

🐾✨ Introducing my Python programming skills with a fun exercise! 🐍🔍 I wrote a Python program featuring two classes: Pet and Person. The Pet class represents pets with attributes like name, animal type, and age. The Person class represents individuals with attributes such as name and phone number. In the program, I created instances of both classes and printed out their attributes. 🐶🐱🦜 Feel free to check out the code and let me know what you think! #PythonProgramming #OOP #CodingFun 🚀💻
